Hi! I'm Jen. Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University in American Politics and Political Methodology. I graduated from Dartmouth College with a BA in Quantitative Social Science, with minors in Government and Japanese.

My research uses surveys and text analysis methods to study politician messaging in the United States and the different perceptions Democrats and Republicans have of their statements. I am particularly interested in politician incentives to be uncivil and the consequences of their words.
