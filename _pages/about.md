Hi! I'm Jen. Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University in American Politics and Political Methodology. My research uses surveys and text analysis methods to study what politicians in the United States are saying and how their statements are perceived by the public. I'm particularly interested in politician incentives to be uncivil and the consequences of their words.
